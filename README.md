## Tutorial Guidelines

### Goal
The goal of a tutorial is to explain how to build something with PistonAPI step by step. 

### Features of PistonAPI

Through the explanation it's good to explain how the features used on the tutorial works and a link to the corresponding documentation. For example, if you gone to create a model **Filter**, explain how a filter will help the project and insert a link to the original documentation.

### Wireframes

Since PistonAPI don't handle frontend (yet ðŸ˜Ž) it's good to have a wireframe to explain to the reader how the user will interact with the prototype that you are building.

To do that, is recommended to use something like [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/)
