## Production Ready

The entire stack (all resources and cloud providers) of PistonAPI is ready to scale as far as your application requires.

## The Low Code Concept

A good way to clarify what is a low code platform is making an analogy with Microsoft Excel. Excel allows building great things without a single line of code, only pointing and clicking. But when you need more features or customizations you can rely on **formulas** which is an extremely controlled environment that you can type small chunks of code to achieve even more incredible results.

With a low code platform, you can also *build great software without writing code*. And when you need to build some advanced features or customizations you got the flexibility to code! And everything is designed to be resolute within tiny chunks of code.

So in a lot of cases is more productively build some graphics and reports on Microsoft Excel rather than writing an entire software from scratch. That is the same with PistonAPI.
